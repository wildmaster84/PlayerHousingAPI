# PlayerHousing API
This is not the source code to my PlayerHousing plugin, its just the baremetal api.

This plugin is to allow players to have full control over their own world on a folia 1.20.4 server.
to access the api, use `PlayerHousing.getAPI();`.

HousingAPI.java should contain all the info you need to work with the api,
but feel free to lmk if something needs to be modified to allow more customization.

# Requirements
- LuckPerms
- Folia 1.20.4

# Note
This plugin has been heavly tested for the past 1-2 years and is the second revision.
its very unlikely for something internal to break, but feel free to open an issue on
GitHub and i will do my best to patch it asap.
